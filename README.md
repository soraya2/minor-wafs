# Pros and cons jQuery
jQuery (what is it?)
jQuery is a JavaScript library that helps to simplify and standardize interactions between JavaScript code and HTML elements. JavaScript allows websites to be interactive and dynamic, and jQuery is a tool that helps streamline that process2.


voordelen jQuerie
- jQuery takes care of crossbrowser compatibility issues1
You don't have to worry about compatibility across browsers because jQuery degrades gracefully when features are not supported or lacking.

- jQuery elements are visible even when Javascript is disabled3
jQuery is loaded after the dom is rendered therefor if you disable javascript the content will still be rendered.

Cons
- Functionality can be limited1
 If you need a lot of customization then it maybe better to use vanilla javascript because you are not bound to the limitations of JQuery. 

- jQuery sugarcoates javascript4
If you are not familiar with the full concept of javascript you might not fully understand what jQuery is actually doing behind the scenes. It could be useful to know when you should consider writing it in vanilla javascript and when jQuery is the better option. But if you don't have enaugh knowlege of vanilla javascript you would never even consider writing out some functionalities yourself even if it could give you more options.

# Pros and cons single page application

spa cons

You only have to load the content once 
Because your loading only one web page it helps users with limited bandwidth.1



spa pro’s

Its seo friendly 
The search engine sees different content and the webpage is therefore not user friendly because the user sees the content that would render if you. Therefore you would get a lower ranking in search engine results. 1
